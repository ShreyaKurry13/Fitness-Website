            <h2>PROGRESSION</h2>
            <p>The principle of progression is the idea that as your body adapts 
                to your exercise routine, you have to increase the intensity to continue to see enhanced 
                fitness. This can mean gradually increasing the weight, duration, or intensity of your weight training
                 in order to see growth. The principle of progression applies to weight training 
                 and endurance, and can be accomplished through 
                 increased resistance, frequency, and duration.</p>

                <p>There are many reasons you may not want to exercise in a gym. Some people feel intimidated in a gym environment. Some may struggle with child care or other logistics.

                    <h2>NUTRITION</h2>
                <p>Diet is a catch-all term that refers to a person’s pattern of eating. Example diets can include vegan, vegetarian, keto, paleo, gluten-free, low-calorie, low-FODMAP, and Mediterranean diets. Each diet has its own set of guidelines that describe what is and isn’t compliant. For example, vegan diets don’t include animal products of any kind and instead are made up of all plant-based foods.Nutrition focuses on different things than nutrition for sports that demand endurance, such as long-distance running or speed skating. Instead, strength training nutrition focuses on enhancing protein intake to build stronger muscles.
